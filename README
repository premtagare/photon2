Version 1:
Stage 1 Bootloader is copied into MBR starting from address 0x3E
This will parse FAT12 filesystem and loads Stage 2 Bootloader from floppy and places it at adress 0x10000 in RAM.
*loadk.s and loadk.bin are just stub, these will be replaced with Stage 2 Bootloader code in the next version.

Run following commands to compile and boot photon2:
make in src folder
./run


Note:
creating new floppy image:
$ dd bs=512 count=2880 if=/dev/zero of=imagefile.img
$ mkfs.msdos imagefile.img


*** Extraordinary Techniques:

1. To take snapshot of RAM, press ctrl+alt+2 while QEMU is runnning and use the following command
   pmemsave starting_address end_address file
   eg: pmemsave 0 0x20000 RAM.dump
